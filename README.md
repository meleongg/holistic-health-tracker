# Holistic Health Tracker

A comprehensive AI-powered health treatment management application built during Nuggethacks, an 8-hour internal club hackathon with nwPlus!

## üîç The Problem We're Solving

Healthcare adherence is notably imbalanced: patients typically adhere to pharmaceutical treatments while often neglecting equally important lifestyle and non-pharmaceutical recommendations. This creates a significant gap in treatment effectiveness, as holistic health management requires both medication adherence and lifestyle modifications. Medical professionals struggle to ensure patients follow complete treatment plans, especially the non-pharmaceutical components that can be crucial for long-term health outcomes.

## üåü Features

- **Treatment Management**: Track pharmaceutical and lifestyle treatments for multiple health conditions
- **Smart Recurrence**: Support for daily, weekly, and monthly treatment schedules
- **Completion Tracking**: Mark treatments as complete and view completion history
- **Condition Dashboard**: Organized view of treatments by medical condition
- **Calendar Integration**: Visual date selection for viewing and tracking treatments
- **Adaptive UI**: Treatments automatically appear based on their frequency schedule
- **AI Treatment Suggestions**: Evidence-based treatment recommendations using RAG technology
- **Medical Knowledge Base**: Built on MedlinePlus data with semantic search capabilities
- **Test Data Generation**: Built-in system to create sample data for testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with React and TypeScript
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
